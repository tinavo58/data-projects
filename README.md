# DATA-PROJECTS

## Personal Spending
This [**project**](/personal-spending/) aims to analyze my 2023 spending by extracting transactions from PDF bank statements. I intend to review my spending habits and identify any areas of overspending throughout the year.


## Job Search

I was curious about the current demand for Data Analysts in Australia, so I conducted a [**job search**](/job-search/) on Seek to gauge the market. The web-scraping was performed on April 26, 2024 :grin:

## HR Reporting
The dashboard was constructed entirely in Excel, starting from data collection and transformation, all the way to building the interactive report. I'm interested in exploring how easily we can achieve the same results using [**SQL**](/hr-reporting/) with the same data source.
